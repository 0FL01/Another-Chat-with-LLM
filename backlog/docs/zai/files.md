# File Management

**Source**: `zai_rs::file`

The `file` module provides capabilities to upload, list, and delete files, which is useful for multimodal inputs or fine-tuning.

## Modules

- `upload`: Upload files to Zhipu AI storage.
- `list`: List uploaded files.
- `content`: Retrieve file content.
- `delete`: Delete files.

## Example Usage

```rust
// Pseudo-code based on module structure
use zai_rs::file::upload;

// Uploading a file
// Check specific function signatures in `zai_rs::file::upload`
```

*Note: Detailed function signatures for file operations were not fully expanded in the initial search, but follow standard Rust async patterns.*
